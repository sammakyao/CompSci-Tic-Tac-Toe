# CompSci-Tic-Tac-Toe

This program replicates one of my favorite games to play called "Tic Tac Toe Game"

RULES FOR TIC TAC TOE GAME

1.	The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2.	You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3.	The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4.	When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie/draw.

FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS

1.	The game should allow the user to play either X or O. 
2.	If the game ends with a tie, X winning or O winning the program should allow the user to exit or restart the game.
